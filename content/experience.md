  To further deepen our experience within the space and better understand customer needs, we have established an active product advisory board as a key company resource.

  The Alucio Product Advisory Board (PAB) is made up of a cross-section of experienced life science professionals with relevant expertise in medical affairs and field medical positions within leading life science companies.

  The PAB provides Alucio leadership with an industry viewpoint and end-user perspective on the company’s product (Beacon), its feature set and future roadmap. This guidance also includes actively communicating user needs, describing workflows and highlighting current market gaps that exist.

  We are very fortunate to have this talented team of engaged industry professionals supporting our efforts.
